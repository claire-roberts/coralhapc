## Coral Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC)

### What are Habitat Areas of Particular Concern and why are they necessary?
A Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC) is a designation that encompasses discrete subsets of Essential Fish Habitat (EFH), which provide extremely important ecological functions or are especially vulnerable to degradation. The purpose of HAPCs is to focus conservation, management, and research efforts on subsets of EFH that are vulnerable to degradation or are especially important ecologically for federally managed fish. The HAPC designation alone does not confer additional protection or restrictions to an area, but helps to focus EFH conservation, management, and research priorities. HAPC designation is a valuable way to acknowledge areas where we have detailed information on ecological function and habitat vulnerability, indicating a greater need for conservation and management. In some instances the Councils and NMFS may develop fishery management measures to conserve the habitat within the HAPC. HAPC designation may be warranted for areas that play a vital role in the reproductive cycle of a managed species (e.g., grouper spawning sites) or areas that contain a rare habitat type (e.g., corals) that may be sensitive to disturbance from fishing or other human activities. Councils may designate an area as a HAPC for one or more of the following reasons: (1) the habitat provides important ecological functions; (2) the habitat is sensitive to human-induced environmental degradation; (3) Development activities are, or will be, stressing the habitat; (4) the habitat type is rare.

#### Purpose



The purpose of this tool is to create an interactive, online mapping application that facilitates review, discussion, and decision making regarding coral HAPCs in the Gulf of Mexico.  New data have identified additional, sensitive areas supporting shallow and deepwater corals in the Gulf of Mexico. The <a href="http://gulfcouncil.org/about/fishery_council_members.php">Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council</a> is considering changes to current HAPC designations to take advantage of this new information consistent with their objective to balance conservation, sustainable use, and socioeconomic benefits of fishery resources in the Gulf. 

More and more, natural resource management questions are "spatial" in nature.  What does that mean?  It means that management tools are often place-based and require different tools to facilitate decision making.  Traditional "static" maps are often inadequate as they always trade off fine-scale detail with the ability to see the "big picture".  A second limitation of static maps is that they only tell the story the author envisioned; there is no ability to explore or ask your own questions with the data.

#### Enter the world of interactive map viewers

Interactive map viewers address many limitations of traditional methods of sharing spatial information.  They allow users to interact with the map. meaning users can move to particular regions, zoom in, out etc. based on their interests.  A longstanding issue with spatial data was that complicated, often expensive software was needed to interact with these data.  Web-based mappers are addressing many of these issues as they run in any modern web-browser on a wide variety of devices and operating systems.  These applications are now widespread because they work so well.  We are leveraging this technology to facilitate decision making and provide stakeholders with improved access to the 'data' supporting management decisions.  

#### What can I do in this mapper?

This is a simple tool to explore current and proposed Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC) in the Gulf of Mexico.  The <a href="http://gulfcouncil.org/about/fishery_council_members.php">Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council</a> is considering changes to current HAPC designations to take advantage of recent research that has identified additional regions supporting deepwater coral formations.  Consideration of new areas has been the subject of on-going discussion of the Council working with their <a href="http://gulfcouncil.org/panels_committees/advisory_panels.php#Coral">Coral Advisory Panel</a> and <a href="http://gulfcouncil.org/panels_committees/scientific_statistical_committees.php">Special Coral Scientific and Statitical Committee</a>. This habitat supports many important fish and invertebrate species and is among the most biologically diverse habitats in the Gulf of Mexico. A summary of joint Coral AP and Special Coral SSC meeting held May 27, 2015 is here: <a href="http://gulfcouncil.org/council_meetings/Briefing%20Materials/BB-06-2015/N-4%20Coral%20AP_SSC%20summary%20May%202015.pdf">Meeting summary</a>. 

The objective of this tool is to permit viewing of current and proposed areas in this region using the interactive mapping (Map) tab.
The mapper contains several 'layers' including (1) designated HAPCs with one of more HAPC specific fishing regulations, (2) designated HAPCs without specific HAPC fishing regulations, and (3) areas that have been recommended for HAPC designation.  Recommendations were based largely on area-specific knowledge of habitats and research identifying and describing corals and coral reefs by the scientific community.  For reference, we have included an aggregated database of known locations supporting deep or shallow water corals.  We do not pretend to have documentation of every coral in the Gulf but we have tried to represent the information as best we know it.  We do plan to update this as new information becomes available and if you know of something we missed please <a href="mailto: portal@gulfcouncil.org"> contact us</a> so we can update our database. 

In total, there are four query able layers that can be turned on or off using the check box in the bottom left corner. The various types of corals recorded at each location are noted in the coral locations legend.  The various HAPC types are discernible by color, and identified in the legend in the bottom right of the viewer.  Geographic coordinates can identified by clicking on the map (Results displayed below map). See the 'How to use' for an in-depth description of the features and how to use them?


<font size="4">How big are these HAPCs in the Gulf of Mexico?</font>

A central question regarding HAPCs is how large are they.  In general, they are small, really small relative to the total area of the Gulf of Mexico but can be considered large if they occur in your fishing grounds and they restrict this activity.  There is also concern, that many small HAPCs add up to a large closure area. Our objective is to allow the user to explore this and reach their own conclusion.  The bar chart (in the top right panel) addresses this question. On initial load, the total area encompassed by HAPCs (with fishing restrictions) and proposed HAPCs is visible (i.e., 1,964 sq. miles).  As you zoom or scroll on the map, the area of HAPCs encompassed in the visible area of the map is displayed in the left bar on the bar chart. The intent is to allow consideration of the total and relative size of HAPCs in the region of interest to the viewer. 


#### How do I make full use of this mapper?
A 'how to' tab is under development with a full description and the features and functions of the mapper. 

#### Show me the data!
That's easy.  The data are available in the tabs on the left panel corresponding the data layer.  If you need the data for your own use, please <a href="mailto: portal@gulfcouncil.org"> contact us</a>.
